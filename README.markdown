totte's configurations
======================
Various configuration files for Arch Linux, Debian GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.
All files are to include a comment on the first lines like so:

\# $SOFTWARE configuration
\# ${DEVICE,ENVIRONMENT} specific (optional)
\# Belongs in /this/specific/directory
\# Notable $EFFECT

Splitting long files into sections with 79 character lines of -'s (the first
character being a # or whatever) is a good idea. Like so:

\#---------------...
\# Section header
\#---------------...
